celery is built for the cleaning for unpaid and expired order... but it's too complex?
Right now I'm not going to activate it to build more functions on it...

Update:
  - the function to modify the artwork's information with approval
  - the product management transfer, initiated by the order management admin and approved by the product approval admin
