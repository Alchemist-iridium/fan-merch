Bring Imagination into Reality

licenced co-fund pre-order fan-art merch + stocking & delivery platform
(a long title, but basically is what it is)

BTW, the git repo is more like a storage space and I didn't thoroughly test all the functions before each update. Therefore, some versions might have a lot of bugs... Always try the latest version would be better.
3.12
add from sqlalchemy.sql import func to the admin_route.py and user_route.py! I mistakenly delete them...

3.11
a better version uploaded, pandas openpyxl should be installed for this new version (readme will be updated when other functions are constructed)

2.23
For anyone who sees this~
- follow me on X @Iridium7735 if you are interested in the project!
    - I would upload some screenshots to help understand the process
- semi-final_2025.2.23 contains all functions except
    - item transfer (need operational process...)
    - follow-notification (and some minor notifications)
- cross functional chart would be uploaded soon (a little bit time consuming... I'm still a student haha)
- the instruction on what packages to add and how to operate the system is in Installation and Demonstration.pdf
